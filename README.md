# InteractiveMapPathfinder
This repository contains an assignment for Programming 2, which consists of two main parts: Graph Data Structure (ListGraph &amp; Edge) and Application for Map-based Pathfinding.
Graph Data Structure (ListGraph & Edge)

Implements an undirected, weighted graph using adjacency lists.
Supports adding, removing, and connecting nodes, as well as pathfinding.
Uses an interface (Graph) to maintain modularity.
Application for Map-based Pathfinding

Allows users to define locations on a map and create connections between them.
Users can save/load maps, display paths, and modify connections.
Implemented using JavaFX for graphical interaction.

Features:
Graph-based representation of locations and routes.
Pathfinding functionality using depth-first search (DFS).
Interactive GUI for creating, modifying, and visualizing the graph.
Supports saving/loading maps in a predefined text format.

How to Run:
Open the Java project.
Run the JavaFX-based application to interact with the map.
Use the implemented graph functions for searching paths between locations.
This project demonstrates graph algorithms and object-oriented programming in Java.
